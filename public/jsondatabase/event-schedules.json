    "session_description": "<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To connect innovation with strategy, aligning institutions and individuals around a shared AI vision for Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>Details: </strong>On this day of the <em>MillionX Bangladesh National AI Challenge</em>, titled <strong>AI Build-a-thon</strong>, is where the nation’s brightest innovators transform ideas into impactful, real-world AI solutions. This full-day event (8:00 AM – 6:00 PM at a University) showcases the top 20 university teams—selected from a nationwide pipeline of 5,000 participants through intensive bootcamps and mentorships—demonstrating working AI prototypes across <strong>five national priority domains: EdTech, AgriTech, HealthTech, E-Commerce, and FinTech.</strong> Each team will present tangible solutions that address Bangladesh’s most pressing challenges—from <strong>personalized learning tutors</strong> and <strong>AI-powered farming ecosystems</strong> to <strong>maternal health companions</strong>, <strong>intelligent supply chains</strong>, and <strong>financial inclusion engines</strong> for the unbanked.</p><p>The <strong>AI Build-a-thon</strong> brings together universities, industry, investors, policymakers, and global experts in one collaborative platform to accelerate Bangladesh’s entry into the AI economy. The day includes live demos, mentorship sessions, and investor networking, culminating in the <strong>Young AI Founders Network Awards</strong>, where the top five teams receive seed funding, mentorship, and incubation support to scale their ventures nationally and globally.</p><p>For <strong>university leaders</strong>, the event highlights how academia can align AI research with employable innovation; for <strong>government policymakers</strong>, it demonstrates AI’s role in advancing “Bangladesh - a destination for AI resources” agenda; and for <strong>sponsors and corporate partners</strong>, it offers an unparalleled opportunity to co-create solutions, talent, and market ecosystems ready for deployment.</p><p>The <strong>AI Build-a-thon</strong> is not just a competition—it is Bangladesh’s bold statement to the world: <strong>that a million young minds, empowered by AI, can engineer the nation’s next era of prosperity, inclusion, and global digital leadership.</strong></p>",

    "session_description": "<p><strong>A cross-sector gathering to explore Bangladesh's AI opportunity and chart a shared path forward</strong></p><p><strong>Location:</strong> UAP Auditorium, Dhaka, Bangladesh (Tentative)</p><h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>MillionX Bangladesh is a national movement founded by Bangladeshi technologists, educators, industry leaders, and global diaspora experts committed to building a generation of 10x minds for a 10x Bangladesh. Our mission is to unlock the country's next wave of economic and social transformation by developing world-class AI talent, strengthening local innovation capacity, and building bridges between Bangladesh and the global technology community.</p><p>We are intentionally designed as an ecosystem-driven, nonpartisan, and pro-bono initiative. MillionX brings together youth, universities, industry, government, civil society, and diaspora networks with a shared belief: Bangladesh must not be a passive consumer of the AI era - it must be a contributor.</p><p>Following the MillionX Build-A-Thon - where hundreds of young innovators have spent two months developing real-world AI solutions - the Genesis AI Conference connects their energy with national vision, leadership, and long-term collaboration. The Conference is the starting point of a multi-year journey to cultivate talent, inspire partnerships, and shape Bangladesh's AI future.</p><p>Rather than attempting to finalise a Bangladesh AI Action Charter in a single day, the Conference presents a Charter Framework (v0.1), gathers structured input, and culminates in the launch of the MillionX Declaration. The refined Charter will be developed collaboratively in the weeks that follow.</p>",
